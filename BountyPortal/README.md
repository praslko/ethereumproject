## Project Objective

Implement Bounty dAPP

## What does Bounty Project do
Implements smart contract (written in solidity) and a Javascript UI to provide following features. 
Test cases have been written in Javascript

Contract has been deployed successfully on Rinkeby test network using Remix. I ran into issues depoying contract on Rinkeby using truffle and Infura. Refer to file deployed_addresses.txt to know contract details on rinkeby network

Contract allows
* Allows job posters to create new bounty
* Allows job hunters to submit work for a bounty 
* Allows job posters to review  submitted work and accept work. Acceptance of a work automatically implies rejection of other works for same bounty
* Allows job hunters to collect Bounty reward if their work is accepted

* Bounty Issuer refers to job poster
* Bounty Executor refers to job hunter

* A job hunter has upto 30 days (from the date & time bounty is enabled by the job poster to submit work

* It costs 1 wei (payable to contract owner) for a job  poster to create a bounty
* It costs 1 wei (payable to contract owner) for a job  poster to enable a bounty so that   
  job hunters can submit work 
* It costs 1 wei (payable to contract owner) for a job hunter to submit work for a
  bounty
* It costs 0 wei for a job poster to review the work submitted    
  by a job  hunter
* It costs 1 wei (payable to contract owner) for a job poster to accept work for a
  bounty
* It costs 0 wei for a job hunter to collect bounty reward

* It costs 0 wei for a contract owner to stop contract/resume contract/know contract balance/withdraw contract balance


Refer to User Stories for details

## State Diagram for a Bounty [<Operation>] --> (<State>)

   [Create Bounty]->(Draft) [Enable Bounty] --> (Active) 
   [Accept Bounty Work] --> (Closed)
   
## State Diagram for Contract

   Stopped --> Not Stopped --> Stopped
   When contract is in stopped state, only master list of bounties can  be viewed and contract balance can be viewed  but no other (readonly/read write) operation is allowed except that if logged in user is contract owner then Resume Contract and Know Contract Balance Operations are allowed


## How to set it up in development environment

Step 1: Ensure following pre-requisite software is installed on your machine. Refer to step 2.1a
* truffle
* ganache
* metamask (chrome extension)
* npm
* node.js
* lite-server
 
  My development environment details listed below 
 
  ### Operating System: Windows 10 (64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor)
  ### truffle version: Truffle v4.1.13 (core: 4.1.13) Solidity v0.4.24 (solc-js)
  ### ganache version: v1.2.1
  ### metamask (chrome extension) version: 4.9.3
  ### npm version: 6.2.0
  ### node.js version: 10.4.1
  ### lite-server version: 2.4.0	

## Steps 2.1 to 2.14 explain how to set up and connect to contract in local development environment

Step 2.1: cd to BountyPortal Directory

Step 2.1a: run command "npm install"

Step 2.2: If you are on windows operating system then delete file truffle.js. If you are on unix operating system then delete file truffle-config.js
          Refer to for https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/38117/truffle-configuration-file-name-is-it-truffle-js-or-truffle-config-js details

Step 2.3: Ensure that either directory BountyPortal\build\contracts does not exist or if it exists is empty

Step 2.4: Run command "truffle compile"

Step 2.5: Launch ganache UI (or start ganache from command line)

Step 2.6: Open file BountyPortal/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js in any text editor and replace the contract address in following line the first address shown in ganache UI
 
		This step is only needed if address  0x0678636e25DaCf509872F7226A9Bf66b3261E2D2 is not the first address generated by ganache. 
 		deployer.deploy(BountyPortal, "0x0678636e25DaCf509872F7226A9Bf66b3261E2D2");

Step 2.7: Run command "truffle compile" while ensuring that your current directory is BountyPortal
                 Your command output will look similar to below
                  Compiling .\contracts\BountyPortal.sol...
 		Compiling .\contracts\Migrations.sol...
 		Writing artifacts to .\build\contracts

Step 2.8: : Run command "truffle migrate" while ensuring that your current directory is BountyPortal
 		Your command output will look similar to below
 		Using network 'development'.
 		Running migration: 1_initial_migration.js
   		Deploying Migrations...
   		... 0xc33377d5e9c36577969aa7a5304976bdc783cdb98dd4c46907d276e56428e244
   		Migrations: 0x942b1964f5968ac0a8a57bbed6fa452bcc49246e
 		Saving successful migration to network...
   		... 0x2fb5fb977b801f507c470ad54e0f96e0249a59f856db8d0eed8e6dc598811e9f
 		Saving artifacts...
 		Running migration: 2_deploy_contracts.js
   		Deploying BountyPortal...
   		... 0x905b997a4bf641d424e642b41b4d2061d44fd7ce7e370fa39b6f89200648787a
   		BountyPortal: 0x18b97e6bcb28f177a1ebf57b356c191db8b34ce0
 		Saving successful migration to network...
   		... 0x177c5c8795f7a7ec9a720e419960c24c164555d0b07e46b2f06e985b18913a78
 		Saving artifacts...

Step 2.9: In the output generated at Step 2.8, take note of the address at which  BountyPortal  contract is deployed (e.g. in above output address at which BountyPortal contract is deployed is 0x18b97e6bcb28f177a1ebf57b356c191db8b34ce0)

Step 2.10: Open file BountyPortal\src\index.html in any text editor and edit line 542 to  ensure that it has same address that was taken note of at Step 2.9. Save the file.
 	   Currently file is using address on Rinkeby network
	
Step 2.11: Run command "npm run dev" while ensuring you are in BountyPortal directory

Step 2.12: Launch metamask GUI from chrome browser and set network to http://127.0.0.1:7545. Metamask GUI  
           should show that it is connected to Private Network

Step 2.13: Launch chrome browser and type in following URL in address bar to access dAPP GUI - http://localhost:3000 

Step 2.14: Start interacting with the dApp. Refer to user stories for details on interaction

## Steps 3.1 to 3.5 explain how to connect to contract on Rinkeby test network

Step 3.1: Run  command "npm install" while ensuring you are in BountyPortal directory
Step 3.2: Run  command "npm run dev" while ensuring you are in BountyPortal directory
Step 3.3: Launch metamask GUI from chrome browser and connect to Rinkeby network 
Step 3.4: Launch chrome browser and type in following URL in address bar to access dAPP GUI - http://localhost:3000 
Step 3.5: Start interacting with the dApp. Refer to user stories for details on interaction


## Actors in BountyPortal
There are following 3 actors

	* Contract Owner: There can be only 1 contract owner. Contract owner is decided at the time contract is deployed. It is not allowed to issue bounty or submit solution work  to bounty. It can only stop contract/resume contract/check & withdraw contract balance

	* Bounty Issuer: This is the job poster. There can be multiple job posters. A job poster can act as job hunter for bounties issued by other job posters. Job poster cannot submit work to its own bounty.

	* Bounty Executor: This is the job hunter. There can be multiple job hunters. Job hunter submits work the bounties issued by other bounty issuers. A job hunter can issue its own bounty and act as job poster as well for other job hunters. 


## Note

### You will need to uninstall and reinstall metamask chrome    
    extension OR reset metamask if javacript console in    
    BountyPortal dAPP GUI shows following message/error   
    "Error: the tx doesn't have
    the correct nonce. account has nonce of: 0 tx has nonce    
    of: 1". Refer to https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-   
    extension/issues/1999
    for details 

### All Bounty ID & Bounty Work ID values in input fields referred to in stories (listed below) and GUI follow 0-based indexing
